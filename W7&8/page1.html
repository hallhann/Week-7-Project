        <p>Coffee definitely stands at my #1 option. My go-to is a white chocolate mocha. Coffee is usually my study drink.</p>

        <p>Boba tea is a close second to coffee. My favorite shop where I live is called <i>Societea.</i> The staff always knows my order: Jasmine milk tea with soy milk. Boba is usually my pick-me-up drink after a hard day.</p>

        <p> Last on the list is Redbull. This is last on the list because it's definitely not the healthiest option. My favorite flavor is coconut. I usually get a Redbull if I know I'm going to have a long day at work or if I need to stay up late to work on school.</p>
